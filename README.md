# home-assistant-projects
This is a repository that details my adventures in home automation, spcifically centred around the open source tool Home Assistant.

The main reason I am creating this repository is for my own benefit.  As of 2020 I haven't done much coding and, while configuring Home Assistant to some may not be consiered as such, it's a very new world to me.
So creating this allows me to put my thoughts, and my efforts on paper, so to speak.  I can return at any time I'm asking myself why I chose to do this, or how did I do that.

Maybe though, just maybe, my efforts will help and influence someone who stumbles in here.

Welcome to my humble, and automated abode.
